### 1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

**Answer:**

Compiler and interpreter are both tools used in the software development process to convert high-level programming languages into machine code or execute them. However, they work differently and have distinct advantages and disadvantages.

**Compiler:**

A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code of a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code in one go. It performs the following steps:

1. **Parsing:** The compiler analyzes the source code to understand its structure and syntax.
2. **Semantic Analysis:** It checks for semantic errors and assigns meaning to the code.
3. **Optimization:** The compiler may perform various optimizations to improve the efficiency of the resulting code.
4. **Code Generation:** The final step involves generating machine code or intermediate code.

**Advantages:**
- The compiled code is generally faster because it is fully translated before execution.
- Errors are caught before the actual execution, reducing the chances of runtime failures.

**Disadvantages:**
- The compilation process takes more time before the program can be executed.
- It may generate larger executable files.

**Interpreter:**

An interpreter, on the other hand, reads the source code line-by-line and executes it directly without generating a separate executable. The steps involved in interpretation are:

1. **Parsing:** The interpreter reads and analyzes the source code line by line.
2. **Execution:** It executes the code line by line, translating and performing the operations as it goes.

**Advantages:**
- It allows for quicker development as the code can be executed without a separate compilation step.
- It usually results in smaller file sizes since there's no need for an intermediate compiled output.

**Disadvantages:**
- The execution of interpreted code is generally slower compared to compiled code.
- Errors may only be discovered during runtime, leading to potentially more difficult debugging.

### 2. See ASCII Table from Internet.

**Answer:**

The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) table is a character encoding standard that represents characters and symbols using numeric codes. Each character is assigned a unique number from 0 to 127.

Here's a part of the ASCII table:

| Decimal | Character | Decimal | Character | Decimal | Character | Decimal | Character |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 0       | NUL       | 32      | Space     | 64      | @         | 96      | `         |

### 3. What is 32 bit vs 64 bit CPU?

**Answer:**

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the width of the CPU's data bus and the registers, which impacts the amount of data the CPU can process at once. Here are the main differences between 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs:

**32-bit CPU:**
- It has a 32-bit data bus and registers.
- It can process 32 bits of data

 at a time.
- The maximum memory addressable by a 32-bit CPU is 2^32, which is approximately 4 gigabytes (GB).
- It can run both 32-bit and 16-bit software but cannot run 64-bit software.

**64-bit CPU:**
- It has a 64-bit data bus and registers.
- It can process 64 bits of data at a time.
- The maximum memory addressable by a 64-bit CPU is 2^64, which is an extremely large value (about 16 exabytes).
- It can run both 32-bit and 64-bit software, offering backward compatibility.

**Advantages of 64-bit over 32-bit:**
- Larger addressable memory allows handling more extensive applications and datasets.
- Improved performance in handling large files and memory-intensive tasks.
- Enhanced security features due to larger address space and improved instruction set.

**Choosing between 32-bit and 64-bit:**
- For older hardware with limited memory (4GB or less), a 32-bit operating system may be sufficient.
- For modern computers with more than 4GB of RAM, a 64-bit operating system is recommended to fully utilize the available memory and achieve better performance.

### 4. Explore various naming conventions of variables?

**Answer:**

Naming conventions for variables are a set of rules and guidelines used to name variables in programming languages. Although naming conventions can vary depending on the language and the specific project or organization, there are some common practices that developers follow to make code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some popular naming conventions for variables:

1. **Camel Case:** In camel case, the first letter of the variable name starts with lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. For example: `userName`, `numberOfItems`, `studentInfo`.

2. **Pascal Case (Upper Camel Case):** Similar to camel case, but the first letter of the variable name starts with an uppercase letter. For example: `FirstName`, `TotalAmount`, `AccountBalance`.

3. **Snake Case:** In snake case, words are separated by underscores, and all letters are usually lowercase. For example: `first_name`, `total_amount`, `account_balance`.

4. **Kebab Case (Spinal Case):** Similar to snake case, but words are separated by hyphens. For example: `first-name`, `total-amount`, `account-balance`.

5. **Hungarian Notation:** This convention prefixes variables with one or more letters indicating the variable's type. For example, `strName` for a string, `iCount` for an integer, `bIsFound` for a boolean.

6. **Screaming Snake Case:** All uppercase letters with words separated by underscores. Often used for constants. For example: `MAX_SIZE`, `PI`, `CONFIG_FILE`.

7. **Abbreviations:** Use abbreviations judiciously and consistently. For example, `msg` for `message`, `num` for `number`, etc.

It's essential to choose a naming convention and stick with it throughout the project to maintain consistency. Additionally, follow any specific guidelines or conventions set by your team or organization.

### 5. Read precedence and associativity table.

**Answer:**

In programming languages, operators have different priorities for evaluation, known as precedence, and some operators may associate with operands in different ways, known as associativity. This determines the order in which expressions are evaluated. Here's a table representing the precedence and associativity of some common operators:

| Precedence | Operator                    | Description                                  | Associativity |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1          | ()                          | Parentheses (grouping)                       | Left to Right |
| 2          | ++, --                      | Postfix increment, postfix decrement        | Left to Right |
| 3          | ++, --                      | Prefix increment, prefix decrement          | Right to Left |
| 4          | +, -                        | Unary plus, unary minus                      | Right to Left |
| 5          | !, ~                        | Logical NOT, bitwise NOT                     | Right to Left |
| 6          | *, /, %                     | Multiplication, division, modulus            | Left to Right |
| 7          | +, -                        | Addition, subtraction                        | Left to Right |
| 8          | <<, >>                      | Bitwise left shift, bitwise right shift      | Left to Right |
| 9          | <, <=, >, >=                | Relational operators                         | Left to Right |
| 10         | ==, !=                      | Equality and inequality operators            | Left to Right |
| 11         | &                          | Bitwise AND                                  | Left to Right |
| 12         | ^                          | Bitwise XOR                                  | Left to Right |
| 13         | \|                         | Bitwise OR                                   | Left to Right |
| 14         | &&                         | Logical AND                                  | Left to Right |
| 15         | \|\|                        | Logical OR                                   | Left to Right |
| 16         | ?:                         | Ternary conditional operator                 | Right to Left |
| 17         | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ... | Assignment operators                         | Right to Left |

Note: Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. In case of the same precedence, the associativity determines the order of evaluation (left-to-right or right-to-left).
