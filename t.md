## Push and Pull (Theme 11)

### 1. Force

1. **What is force? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** A push or pull applied on an object is called force.

2. **Differentiate between a push and a pull with one example each. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** In the case of a push, the force moves the object away from us, for example, closing a door by pushing it. In the case of a pull, the force brings the object toward us, for example, opening a door by pulling it.

3. **State the two conditions required for work to be done. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. We need to apply force on an object.
   2. The object must change its position or shape after the force is applied on it.

4. **Why is work not done when we try to push a concrete wall that does not move? (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** Work is not done because, although we apply force, the wall does not change its position or shape.

5. **Give two examples from daily life where you apply force and the object changes its shape. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Kneading dough, where the dough changes its shape.
   2. Hammering a nail, where the nail’s shape changes as it goes into wood.

6. **Explain why force cannot be seen but can be felt. Support your answer with an example. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** Force itself is invisible, but we can feel its effect when it moves or changes the shape of an object. For example, we cannot see the force when we kick a football, but we feel the kick and see the ball move.

7. **Describe what happens when we open and close a door, mentioning the type of force and the direction of movement. (4 marks)**
   **Answer:** When we open a door from the inside, we pull it by applying force, and the door moves toward us. When we close the door, we push it by applying force, and the door moves away from us. Both actions use muscular force.

### 2. Effects of Force

1. **List any three effects of force on an object. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. A force can move a stationary object.
   2. A force can change the shape of an object.
   3. A force can stop a moving object.

2. **Explain with an example how force can increase the speed of a moving object. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** When a cricketer hits a rolling ball with the bat, the bat applies force on the ball in the same direction as its motion, making it move faster.

3. **Describe what happens when you try to catch a ball with your hands, mentioning the effect of force. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When you catch a ball, your hands apply force opposite to the ball’s motion. This force stops the moving ball.

4. **How does force change the direction of a moving object? Give one example. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** Force can act at an angle to the motion of an object, causing it to change direction. For example, when we use a bat to strike a ball from the side, the ball changes its path.

5. **Why does a moving bicycle slow down when you stop pedaling? Identify the effect of force involved. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When you stop pedaling, frictional force between the bicycle’s wheels and the ground acts on the wheels and slows down the bicycle.

6. **Explain how force can stop a moving object, with an everyday example. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** A force applied opposite to the motion of an object brings it to rest. For example, applying brakes on a bicycle exerts frictional force, which stops the bicycle.

7. **Describe how force can change the shape of dough when kneading. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When we knead dough, our hands apply muscular force repeatedly, causing the dough to stretch and change its shape.

### 3. Types of Forces

#### 3.1 Muscular Force

1. **What is muscular force? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Muscular force is the force applied by our body parts using the action of our muscles.

2. **Give two examples of actions done using muscular force. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Kicking a football involves muscular force from our leg muscles.
   2. Cycling involves muscular force from our leg and arm muscles when pedaling and steering.

3. **Explain why opening a door involves muscular force. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When we open a door, our hand muscles pull the door toward us. This is muscular force because it uses our muscles to move the door.

4. **Describe how muscular force helps us pluck fruits from a tree. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** To pluck fruits, we use the muscles in our arms and hands to pull the fruit gently from the branch, using muscular force.

5. **Why do all movements of our body occur due to muscular force? (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** Muscular force is produced by the contraction of muscles attached to bones. When muscles contract, they pull on bones and create movement. Thus, every time we walk, run, lift, or write, muscular force is responsible.

6. **Describe two daily activities that would not be possible without muscular force. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Writing with a pencil would not be possible without muscular force in our hand and finger muscles.
   2. Eating food by bringing it from the plate to our mouth requires muscular force in our arm and hand muscles.

#### 3.2 Magnetic Force

1. **What is magnetic force? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Magnetic force is the force with which a magnet attracts or repels iron objects or another magnet.

2. **Name the two poles of a magnet. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Each magnet has a north pole and a south pole.

3. **State what happens when like poles of two magnets are brought near each other. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Like poles of two magnets repel each other.

4. **State what happens when unlike poles of two magnets are brought near each other. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Unlike poles of two magnets attract each other.

5. **Describe an activity to observe magnetic force using a small magnet, a cardboard, and paper clips. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Place a few paper clips on the cardboard.
   2. Hold a small magnet below the cardboard.
   3. Move the magnet under the cardboard, and the paper clips will move in the same direction as the magnet.
      This shows that magnetic force is moving the paper clips through the cardboard.

6. **Explain what is meant by the magnetic field. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** The magnetic field is the area around a magnet where its magnetic force can attract or repel objects. It is effective up to a certain distance from the magnet.

7. **Give two examples of how magnetic force is used in daily life. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. In refrigerator magnets, magnetic force holds notes and pictures on the refrigerator door.
   2. In compasses, magnetic force helps the needle align with Earth’s magnetic field to show direction.

#### 3.3 Gravitational Force

1. **Define gravitational force. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Gravitational force is the force that attracts or pulls objects toward the centre of the Earth.

2. **Why does an apple fall from a tree towards the ground? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Because the force of gravity pulls the apple toward the centre of the Earth.

3. **When you throw a ball up in the sky, why does it come back down? (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** The force of gravity acts on the ball, pulling it back toward the ground after it reaches a certain height.

4. **Mention two effects of gravitational force in our Solar System. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. It holds the Moon in orbit around the Earth.
   2. It keeps the planets revolving around the Sun.

5. **Explain how gravitational force is important for life on Earth. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** Gravitational force keeps water in oceans and rivers, ensuring that we have water to drink. It also keeps our feet firmly on the ground, allowing us to walk and move without floating away.

6. **Describe how gravity affects objects of different weights when dropped from the same height. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** In the absence of air resistance, gravitational force accelerates all objects equally, so both a heavy object and a light object dropped from the same height will fall at the same rate and reach the ground together.

#### 3.4 Frictional Force

1. **What is frictional force? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Frictional force is the force that opposes the motion of one object over another object when they are in contact.

2. **Give two examples where friction is helpful. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Friction between our shoes and the ground helps us walk without slipping.
   2. Friction between a pencil and paper helps us write.

3. **Give two examples where friction is not helpful. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Friction between bicycle chains and gears creates heat and wears them out.
   2. Friction between car brakes and wheels can cause the brakes to heat up and wear out over time.

4. **Explain why a ball rolling on the ground eventually comes to a stop. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** As the ball rolls, frictional force between the ball and the ground opposes its motion, causing it to slow down and eventually stop.

5. **How does the roughness of a surface affect friction? Give an example. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:** Rough surfaces provide more friction than smooth surfaces. For example, a rough road surface provides more friction to the tires of a vehicle, helping it to move without slipping, whereas a smooth ice surface provides very little friction, causing things to slide.

6. **Describe how frictional force helps vehicles to move on roads. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** The friction between the vehicle’s tires and the road surface provides the grip needed for the tires to push against the road, allowing the vehicle to start, stop, and change direction.

7. **Explain why we need friction to walk. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When we walk, our feet push backward on the ground. Frictional force from the ground pushes our feet forward, allowing us to move without slipping.

8. **What happens to wheels of a bicycle when we apply brakes? Identify the type of force involved. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** When we apply brakes, frictional force between the brake pads and the wheels opposes the motion, causing the bicycle to slow down and stop.

### 6. Higher-Order Questions

1. **Explain the relationship between force and work, using two examples from daily life. (4 marks)**
   **Answer:**
   Force is the push or pull applied to an object, and work is done when a force causes an object to move or change shape. For example:

   1. When we lift a book from the floor to a table, we apply muscular force to the book. The book moves upward against gravity, so work is done.
   2. When we try to push a heavy box that does not move, we apply force, but since the box does not change its position, work is not done.

2. **Compare and contrast gravitational force and magnetic force with two similarities and two differences. (6 marks)**
   **Answer:**
   **Similarities:**

   1. Both are non-contact forces: neither requires touching the object directly.
   2. Both can cause objects to move toward or away: gravity pulls objects toward Earth, and magnets attract or repel objects.
      **Differences:**
   3. Gravitational force always attracts objects toward the Earth’s centre, while magnetic force can both attract and repel magnetic materials.
   4. Gravitational force acts on all objects with mass, whereas magnetic force acts only on objects made of magnetic materials like iron, nickel, or cobalt.

3. **Describe an experiment to show that friction can both help and oppose motion. (5 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   1. Take a smooth wooden board and a toy car. Place the toy car on the board and gently push it. Observe that the car moves easily because the smooth surface provides little friction.
   2. Now flip the board to show a rough side (e.g., attach coarse sandpaper). Place the toy car on the rough side and push it with the same force. Observe that the car moves more slowly or may not move at all because the rough surface provides more friction.
   3. From this experiment, we see that friction can oppose motion (slowing the car on the rough surface), but it can also help (if the car’s wheels push against a surface to move forward without slipping).

4. **A child pulls a toy car with a string. The car moves 2 metres in 4 seconds before stopping. Identify the type(s) of force involved at each stage and describe their effects. (6 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   * When the child pulls the toy car with a string, muscular force is applied by the child’s arm muscles. This force causes the car to move from rest.
   * As the car moves along the floor, frictional force between the car’s wheels and the floor opposes its motion. This friction makes the car slow down.
   * Eventually, the car stops because frictional force removes the car’s kinetic energy, bringing it to rest.
     Thus, muscular force started the motion, and frictional force stopped the motion.
