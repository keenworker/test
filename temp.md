*(Questions are grouped by parts of the chapter. Each question shows the assigned marks at its end; answers are written in simple, full sentences.)*

## Part A: Digestive System of Humans

1. **Define digestion. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Digestion is the process of breaking down food into simpler forms so that nutrients can be absorbed by our body.

2. **Name all the organs present in the alimentary canal. (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** The organs present in the alimentary canal are: mouth, oesophagus (food pipe), stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.

3. **What is the role of saliva in digestion? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** Saliva makes food moist and soft, helps in swallowing, and contains an enzyme that starts the digestion of carbohydrates.

4. **Where does the digestion of proteins begin? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach.

5. **Fill in the blanks: (Fill in the Blanks: 1 mark each)**
   a. The throat tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   &#x20; **Answer:** oesophagus
   b. The tube‐like structure that absorbs water from undigested food is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   &#x20; **Answer:** large intestine
   c. The digestive juice secreted by the liver is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   &#x20; **Answer:** bile
   d. The process of breaking down food into simpler form is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   &#x20; **Answer:** digestion
   e. The first part of the alimentary canal is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
   &#x20; **Answer:** mouth

6. **Explain how food moves from the mouth to the stomach. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** After we chew and swallow food in the mouth, the muscles of the oesophagus push the food down the food pipe. This action moves the food into the stomach.

7. **Why is proper chewing of food necessary? Give two reasons. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** Proper chewing of food is necessary because it breaks the food into small pieces, making it easy to swallow, and it mixes food with saliva so that digestion of carbohydrates can begin at once.

8. **List two functions of the stomach in digestion. (2 marks)**
   **Answer:** (i) The stomach mixes food with digestive juices and acid to turn it into a thick liquid. (ii) It begins the digestion of proteins in the food.

9. **Draw and label a simple diagram of the human digestive system. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   * **Diagram:** A long tube starting at the mouth, showing oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. To the side, draw liver with bile duct, gall bladder beneath the liver, pancreas below the stomach, and salivary glands near the mouth.
   * **Labels (3 points):**

     1. Mouth
     2. Oesophagus
     3. Stomach
     4. Small Intestine
     5. Large Intestine

     8. Liver
     9. Gall Bladder
     10. Pancreas
         *(Students should draw neatly and label at least six organs to score 3 marks.)*

10. **Describe the process of digestion from the mouth up to the small intestine. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * In the mouth, teeth bite, chew, and grind food. Food mixes with saliva, which makes it moist and soft. Saliva has an enzyme that starts breaking down carbohydrates.
    * The food moves down the oesophagus as muscles push it into the stomach.
    * In the stomach, food stays for two to four hours. Stomach walls secrete acid and digestive juices. The food is turned into a thick liquid, and protein digestion begins.
    * This liquid then goes into the small intestine. In the small intestine, digestive juices from the liver (bile) and pancreas mix with the food. Enzymes break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into even simpler nutrients that can be absorbed into the blood.

11. **What is bile? Name its source and state its role. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * Bile is a digestive juice that does not contain enzymes but helps in the breakdown of fats.
    * It is secreted by the **liver** and stored in the **gall bladder**.
    * Its role is to break large fat droplets into smaller ones so that enzymes can digest them easily.

12. **Explain why the small intestine is called the “site of complete digestion and absorption.” (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * The small intestine is where the thick liquid from the stomach mixes with bile (from the liver) and pancreatic juice (from the pancreas).
    * Enzymes in these juices break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into very simple nutrients.
    * These nutrients are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine directly into the blood.
    * Therefore, complete digestion (breaking down into absorbable parts) and absorption of food happen in the small intestine.

13. **Give two reasons why the liver and pancreas are called accessory organs of digestion. (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    1. They are not part of the main tube (alimentary canal), but they produce juices that help digestion.
    2. The liver secretes bile that helps break down fats, and the pancreas secretes enzymes that help digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

14. **List three benefits of chewing food properly. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    1. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, making it easy to swallow.
    2. Chewing mixes food with saliva, which begins the digestion of carbohydrates.
    3. Chewing strengthens our teeth, gums, and jaws.

15. **Explain how undigested parts of food are handled by our bodies. (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * Parts like fibre that cannot be digested move from the small intestine into the large intestine.
    * The large intestine absorbs water from these undigested parts.
    * The leftover semi-solid waste, called faeces, goes into the rectum and is stored until it leaves the body through the anus.

16. **Fill in the blanks: (Fill in the Blanks: 1 mark each)**
    a. The part of digestive system where most fats are digested is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    &#x20; **Answer:** small intestine
    b. The juice that helps digest carbohydrates in the mouth is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    &#x20; **Answer:** saliva
    c. The mixture of food and digestive juices in the stomach becomes a thick \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    d. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the largest internal organ that secretes bile.
    &#x20; **Answer:** liver
    e. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are the glands that make pancreatic juice.
    &#x20; **Answer:** pancreas

17. **Why should we not eat too fast and swallow the whole food at once? (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * If we eat too fast or swallow large pieces, the food may not mix well with saliva, causing poor digestion.
    * Swallowing quickly can cause choking because the oesophagus may not move the large piece easily.

18. **Name any two taste sensations that our tongue can detect. (1 mark)**
    **Answer:** For example, **sweet** and **bitter**. (Other correct answers: sour or salty.)

## Part B: Excretory System of Humans

5. **Explain how urine is formed and passed out of the body. (3 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   * The kidneys filter waste products and extra water from the blood to form urine.
   * Urine flows down narrow tubes called **ureters** into the **urinary bladder**, where it is stored.
   * During urination, the bladder muscles contract, and urine moves out through the **urethra** into the outside of the body.

6. **Why is the urethra shorter in females than in males? (1 mark)**
   **Answer:** The urethra is shorter in females because of differences in body structure; it is closer to the surface in females.

7. **What role do sweat glands in the skin play in excretion? (2 marks)**
   **Answer:**

   * Sweat glands release excess waste water and salts from the body in the form of sweat.
   * This helps in removing extra water and salts, and also helps to cool the body.
