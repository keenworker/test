### 1. Introduction

Our body needs energy to carry out day‐to‐day activities. We get this energy from the nutrients present in our food. These nutrients, however, cannot be absorbed by our body directly. Therefore, food is first broken down into smaller and simpler forms so that digestion can take place. Once digestion is over, the waste parts of food and the extra water and salts produced by our body must be removed. This removal process is called excretion. In this chapter, we will learn about:

* **The Digestive System of Humans**
* **The Excretory System of Humans**
* **Healthy Habits for Digestion and Excretion**

## 2. Digestive System of Humans

#### 2.1 What Is Digestion?

* **Digestion** is the process of breaking down food into simpler forms. Once food is in a simple form, nutrients can be absorbed into the blood and carried to different parts of the body for energy.

#### 2.2 Organs of the Digestive System

All the organs that help in digestion together form the **digestive system**. The main parts of the digestive system are:

1. **Mouth** (also called the buccal or oral cavity)

   * The first part of the **alimentary canal**.
   * Contains teeth and tongue.
   * Chews, grinds, and mixes food with saliva.
2. **Food Pipe / Oesophagus**

   * A muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.
3. **Stomach**

   * A bag‐like organ where food is stored for 2 to 4 hours.
   * Secretes acid and other digestive juices.
   * Begins digestion of proteins.
4. **Small Intestine**

   * Next to the stomach.
   * Receives digestive juices from the **liver**, **pancreas**, and **gall bladder**.
   * Completes digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
   * Absorbs nutrients through its walls into the blood.
5. **Large Intestine**

   * Receives undigested food from the small intestine.
   * Absorbs water from the leftover material.
6. **Rectum**

   * The last part of the large intestine.
   * Stores semi-solid waste (faeces).
7. **Anus**

   * The opening through which faeces leave the body.

In addition to this “tube,” there are **accessory glands** that help digestion:

* **Liver**

  * The largest internal organ.
  * Secretes a digestive juice called **bile**, which helps break down fats.
  * Stores bile in the **gall bladder**.
* **Pancreas**

  * Secretes digestive juices containing enzymes that help break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
* **Salivary Glands**

  * Produce saliva in the mouth.
  * Saliva makes food moist, soft, and begins digestion of carbohydrates.

Together, the alimentary canal plus the liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and salivary glands form the complete **digestive system**.

#### 2.3 Process of Digestion (Step by Step)

1. **In the Mouth**

   * When we take food into our mouth, the **teeth** bite, chew, and grind the food into smaller pieces.
   * The food mixes with **saliva**, which makes it moist and soft so that it can be swallowed easily.
   * Saliva has an **enzyme** that starts the digestion of **carbohydrates** (sugars and starches).

2. **Through the Oesophagus**

   * From the mouth, the food moves down into the **food pipe (oesophagus)**.
   * The muscles of the oesophagus push the food down into the **stomach**.

3. **In the Stomach**

   * Food remains here for **two to four hours**.
   * The walls of the stomach secrete **acid** and **digestive enzymes** that turn the solid food into a thick liquid mixture.
   * **Proteins** begin to be digested in the stomach. (Carbohydrates do not finish digesting here.)

4. **In the Small Intestine**

   * The thick liquid from the stomach flows into the **small intestine**.
   * Here, the liquid mixes with **bile** (from the liver/gall bladder) and **pancreatic juice** (from the pancreas).
   * Enzymes in these juices break down the food into even simpler forms.
   * **Fats and oils** are mainly digested in the small intestine.
   * When digestion is complete, **nutrients** pass through the walls of the small intestine into the **blood**, which carries them to every part of the body.

5. **Into the Large Intestine**

   * Some parts of food (like **fibre** from fruits and vegetables) cannot be digested.
   * These undigested parts pass directly into the **large intestine**.
   * The large intestine **absorbs water** from the undigested waste.

6. **Rectum and Anus**

   * The semi‐solid waste left over moves into the **rectum**, where it is stored as **faeces**.
   * When it is ready to leave the body, the faeces pass out through the **anus**.

#### 2.4 Role of Liver and Pancreas

* **Liver**

  * Secretes **bile**, a digestive juice that does **not** have enzymes but helps break down **fats** into smaller droplets.
  * Bile is stored in the **gall bladder** and released into the small intestine when needed.
* **Pancreas**

  * Produces **pancreatic juice** containing enzymes.
  * These enzymes help digest all three main nutrients: **carbohydrates**, **proteins**, and **fats**.

#### 2.5 Need for Chewing Food

Proper chewing of food is very important because:

* **Chewing** breaks food into smaller pieces and mixes it with saliva, making it easier to **swallow**.
* Saliva’s enzymes begin the digestion of **carbohydrates** at once.
* Smaller pieces of food move easily down the **oesophagus**.
* Chewing helps **strengthen** our **teeth**, **gums**, and **jaws**.
* If we do not chew properly, big pieces of food may cause **choking** or poor digestion.

#### 2.6 Tasting Food

* We can taste different variety of foods due to the presence of **taste buds** on our tongue.
* The **central area** of the tongue contains **few** taste buds, while the sides and tip have many.

## 3. Excretory System of Humans

After food is digested, what is left over is called **waste**. The process of removing waste products from the body is called **excretion**. Our body has several ways of excreting waste:

* **Lungs** (remove carbon dioxide when we breathe out)
* **Skin** (sweat glands release excess water and salts as **sweat**)
* **Urinary System** (main system that removes waste in the form of **urine**)

The main parts of the **urinary (excretory) system** are:

1. **Kidneys** (a pair)

   * Bean‐shaped organs.
   * Filter blood to remove waste products and excess water and salts.
   * Produce **urine**, which flows out through the **ureters**.
2. **Ureters** (two tubes)

   * Muscular tubes about **25–30 cm** long in adults.
   * Carry urine from each kidney to the **urinary bladder**.
3. **Urinary Bladder**

   * A hollow, elastic, muscular organ that **stores** urine before it leaves the body.
   * During **urination**, its muscles contract and push urine into the **urethra**.
4. **Urethra**

   * A duct that conveys urine from the urinary bladder **out of the body**.
   * The length of the urethra is shorter in females than in males.

Together, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra form our **excretory system**.

## 4. Need of Water for Digestion and Excretion

* **Water** is essential for our body. About **three‐fourths** of our body weight is made of water.
* Water helps in the **absorption of nutrients** in the small intestine.
* If there is **insufficient water**, bowel movements become difficult and can lead to **constipation**.
* The toxins produced in our body cannot exit without water.
* Water also **regulates** our body temperature.
* Therefore, it is essential to **drink at least 8–10 glasses** of water every day.

## 5. Healthy Habits for Digestion and Excretion

To keep our digestive and excretory systems healthy, we should follow these habits:

1. **Wash your hands** before and after meals.
2. **Eat meals at a fixed time** every day.
3. **Chew the food properly**. It helps in better absorption of nutrients and prevents choking.
4. **Do not talk while eating**. Talking while eating can cause choking.
5. **Do not overeat**. Eat in moderation.
6. **Do not drink water during meals**. It can dilute digestive juices.
7. **Rinse your mouth** properly after eating anything.
8. **Do not play or sleep immediately after eating**. Give time for digestion.
9. **Eat lots of fruits and vegetables** to add roughage (fibre) in your diet.
10. **Avoid eating junk and fatty food**.
11. **Eat fresh and properly cooked food**. Stale or unhygienic food can make you sick.
12. **Stay hydrated** by drinking enough water every day.

     10. Pancreas
         *(Students should draw neatly and label at least six organs to score 3 marks.)*

10. **Describe the process of digestion from the mouth up to the small intestine. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * In the mouth, teeth bite, chew, and grind food. Food mixes with saliva, which makes it moist and soft. Saliva has an enzyme that starts breaking down carbohydrates.
    * The food moves down the oesophagus as muscles push it into the stomach.
    * In the stomach, food stays for two to four hours. Stomach walls secrete acid and digestive juices. The food is turned into a thick liquid, and protein digestion begins.
    * This liquid then goes into the small intestine. In the small intestine, digestive juices from the liver (bile) and pancreas mix with the food. Enzymes break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into even simpler nutrients that can be absorbed into the blood.

11. **What is bile? Name its source and state its role. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * Bile is a digestive juice that does not contain enzymes but helps in the breakdown of fats.
    * It is secreted by the **liver** and stored in the **gall bladder**.
    * Its role is to break large fat droplets into smaller ones so that enzymes can digest them easily.

12. **Explain why the small intestine is called the “site of complete digestion and absorption.” (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * The small intestine is where the thick liquid from the stomach mixes with bile (from the liver) and pancreatic juice (from the pancreas).
    * Enzymes in these juices break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into very simple nutrients.
    * These nutrients are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine directly into the blood.
    * Therefore, complete digestion (breaking down into absorbable parts) and absorption of food happen in the small intestine.

13. **Give two reasons why the liver and pancreas are called accessory organs of digestion. (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    1. They are not part of the main tube (alimentary canal), but they produce juices that help digestion.
    2. The liver secretes bile that helps break down fats, and the pancreas secretes enzymes that help digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

14. **List three benefits of chewing food properly. (3 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    1. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, making it easy to swallow.
    2. Chewing mixes food with saliva, which begins the digestion of carbohydrates.
    3. Chewing strengthens our teeth, gums, and jaws.

15. **Explain how undigested parts of food are handled by our bodies. (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * Parts like fibre that cannot be digested move from the small intestine into the large intestine.
    * The large intestine absorbs water from these undigested parts.
    * The leftover semi-solid waste, called faeces, goes into the rectum and is stored until it leaves the body through the anus.

16. **Fill in the blanks: (Fill in the Blanks: 1 mark each)**
    a. The part of digestive system where most fats are digested is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    &#x20; **Answer:** small intestine
    b. The juice that helps digest carbohydrates in the mouth is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    c. The mixture of food and digestive juices in the stomach becomes a thick \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    &#x20; **Answer:** liquid
    d. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the largest internal organ that secretes bile.
    &#x20; **Answer:** liver
    e. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are the glands that make pancreatic juice.
    &#x20; **Answer:** pancreas

17. **Why should we not eat too fast and swallow the whole food at once? (2 marks)**
    **Answer:**

    * If we eat too fast or swallow large pieces, the food may not mix well with saliva, causing poor digestion.
    * Swallowing quickly can cause choking because the oesophagus may not move the large piece easily.

18. **Name any two taste sensations that our tongue can detect. (1 mark)**
    **Answer:** For example, **sweet** and **bitter**. (Other correct answers: sour or salty.)

## Part B: Excretory System of Humans
